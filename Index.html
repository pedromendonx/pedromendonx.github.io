<p2> He gives another smile <br>

    Tries to understand her side <br>

    To show that he cares <br>

    She can't stay in the room <br>

    She's consumed <br>

    With everything that's been goin' on <br> </p2>

<br>

<p3> She says "Whatever happens <br>

    "Don't let go of my hand" <br> </p3>

<br>



<p4>Everything will be alright <br>

    He assures her <br>

    But she doesn't hear a word that he says <br>

    Preoccupied <br>

    She's afraid <br>

    Afraid what they've been doing's not right <br>

    He doesn't know what to say <br>

    So he prays <br>

    "Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever happens" <br> </p4>

<br>

<p5>

    "Don't let go of my hand" <br>

    (Don't let go of my hand) <br> 

    He says "Whatever happens <br>

    "Don't let go of my hand" <br>

    (Don't let go of my hand) <br>

    "Whatever happens" <br>

    "Don't you let go of my hand" <br> </p5> 

<br>

<p6> Doo doo doo doo <br>

    (Doo doo doo doo) Yeah! <br>

    (Doo doo doo doo) <br>

    (Don't let go of my hand) (doo doo doo doo) Oh no <br>

    (Doo doo doo doo) <br> 

    <br>

    He's working day and night <br> 

    Thinks he'll make her happy <br> 

    Forgetting all the dreams that he had <br>

    He doesn't realize <br> 

    It's not the end of the world <br> 

    It doesn't have to be that bad <br> 

    She tries to explain <br> 

    "It's you that makes me happy" <br> 

    "Whatever, whatever, whatever whatever happens" <br> 

    <br>

    "Don't let go of my hand" <br>

    (Don't let go of my hand) <br>

    "See, whatever happens <br>

    "Don't you let go of my hand" (don't let go of my hand) <br>

    (Don't let go of my had) <br>

    "See, whatever happens" <br>

    "Don't let go of my hand" <br>

    (Don't let go of my hand) <br>

    "See, whatever happens" <br> 

    "Don't you let go of my hand" (don't let go of my hand) <br>

    <br>

    See, don't you do it, baby! (don't let go of my hand) <br>

    I say yeah! <br> 

    (Don't let go of my hand) Don't you let go, baby! <br> 

    See, baby, yeah! <br> 

    (Doo doo doo doo) See you <br>

    (Don't let go of my hand) Don't you do it! <br>

    (Doo doo doo doo) <br>

    <br>

    Whatever happens (sha na na na) <br>

    (Ooh sha na na na) Don't let go of my hand <br>

    (Sha na na na, ooh sha na na na) <br> 

    Whatever happens (sha na na na) <br>

    (Ooh, sha na na na) Don't you let go of my hand <br>

    (Sha na na na, ooh sha na na na) <br>

    Whatever happens (sha na na na) <br>

    (Ooh sha na na na) Don't you let go of my hand <br>

    (Sha na na na, ooh sha na na na) <br>

    Don't you let go, baby! (sha na na na) <br>

    (Ooh sha na na na) Don't you, don't you let go! <br>

    (Sha na na na, ooh sha na na na) I say yeah! <br>

    (Sha na na na, ooh sha na na na) <br>

    Can I get a big kiss, baby <br>

    Yeah! (sha na na na) <br>

    Ho! (ooh sha na na na) <br>

    <br>

    Whatever happens (doo doo) <br>

    Just don't let go of (doo doo) <br>

    My hand <br>

    Carlos: Thank you, man <br>

    Michael: Thank you, Carlos <br> </p6>
